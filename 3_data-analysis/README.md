# Data analysis

In this part we will do some data analysis on the data we have scraped - or any other data for that matter. For that you will need to install the [`jupyter lab`](https://jupyter.org/install) environment, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) and the [`pandas` library](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) (please refer to *Installing from PyPI* with `pip`).
