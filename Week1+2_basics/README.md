 
# Week 1&2: Basics
Welcome to the course! See below for the resources & homework. You can find the slides from the session in this folder as well. To view them on your own computer, click right up on "download as zip" and open the `index.html` file.

A large part of programming is self-study. To foster this mindset, in the first 6 weeks you will be mostly on your own.

Below you can find a list of concepts you should know how and when to use by the end of these two weeks.

To not leave you completely on your own, I did some pre-resarch for resources you can use to get familiar with the concepts below. 

Suggested path: if you are completely new to this, start with the 7 days free trial of Programiz. For the second week pick up the video or book.

If you are familiar with some programming and concepts, go straight for the other resources. Feel free to skip the parts that are introducing concepts that are not in the list.

Feel free to use other resources and LLM assistants to help you further. For tips how to use LLMs for learning see [Using LLMs for learning](resources/usingllms.md)
